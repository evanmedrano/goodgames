# Reason for this project

After creating the Goodreads clone, I didn't want to just continue building MVPs of known companies but instead create an original idea. 

My idea is essentially a Goodreads for games. A website that allows a user to look up games they've may or may not have beat and add it to their personal gaming library. There will be a ton of other features I'll include as well, but all in all, this will be a website to keep track of your gaming history.

There may already be a website similar to this, and if there is, I intentially chose to not look for it as it can skew my approach to building this app.

This app will expand on what I've accomplished in the Goodreads app with the inclusion of testing, more clear/concise html/css code, and perhaps a more verbose front-end.
