        was published by Valve Corporation in digital form and by Electronic Arts
        in physical form. </p>\n<p>Its plot directly follows the first game&#39;s,
        taking place in the Half-Life universe. You play as Chell, a test subject
        in a research facility formerly ran by the company Aperture Science, but taken
        over by an evil AI that turned upon its creators, GladOS. After defeating
        GladOS at the end of the first game but failing to escape the facility, Chell
        is woken up from a stasis chamber by an AI personality core, Wheatley, as
        the unkempt complex is falling apart. As the two attempt to navigate through
        the ruins and escape, they stumble upon GladOS, and accidentally re-activate

        game&#39;s ; the player must make their way through several test chambers
        which involve puzzles. For this purpose, they possess a Portal Gun, a weapon
        capable of creating teleportation portals on white surfaces. This seemingly
        simple mechanic and its subtleties coupled with the many different puzzle
        elements that can appear in puzzles allows the game to be easy to start playing,

        such as gel that can render surfaces bouncy or allow you to accelerate when
        running on them.</p>\n<p>The game is often praised for its gameplay, its memorable
        dialogue and writing and its aesthetic. Both games in the series are responsible
        for inspiring most puzzle games succeeding them, particularly first-person

        gun and the companion cube have become a cultural icon within gaming communities.</p>\n<p>Portal
